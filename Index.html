<h1>What is SuperAmerica</h1>
<p>Super America was known as a gas station franchise. The old SA was around for a long time hence why the name sounds so familiar,
  then it got bought out by speedway and now the name Super America is available and now I have turned it into SuperAmerica Clothing
& Co.
